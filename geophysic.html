    <h1>Geophysics Overview</h1>

    <p>Geophysics is a multidisciplinary field using physical principles to 
        investigate Earth's interior. Techniques like seismic, magnetic, 
        gravity, and remote sensing methods are employed for studying subsurface 
        structures, geological formations, and environmental phenomena. 
        Geophysicists contribute to understanding Earth's composition, tectonic 
        processes, and resource distribution, impacting mineral exploration, 
        environmental monitoring, infrastructure development, and hazard assessment.</p>

    <h2>Remote Sensing</h2>

    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Collecting Earth surface and atmospheric 
        data from a distance using sensors on satellites or other platforms.</p>

    <p><strong>Applications:</strong> Remote sensing aids in agriculture, forestry, 
        environmental science, urban planning, disaster management, and climate studies. 
        It provides essential tools for large-scale data collection, monitoring, 
        and decision-making regarding natural resources.</p>

    <h2>Applied Geophysics</h2>

    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Applying physical principles to address practical 
        problems in various industries and applications.</p>

    <p><strong>Applications:</strong> Applied geophysics plays a crucial role in 
        environmental studies, civil engineering, mineral exploration, and natural 
        resource management. It is employed for mapping subsurface structures, 
        locating groundwater resources, assessing soil composition, and identifying 
        mineral or hydrocarbon deposits.</p>

    <h2>Environmental Geophysics</h2>

    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Applying geophysical methods to study and analyze 
        the Earth's subsurface concerning environmental issues.</p>

    <p><strong>Applications:</strong> Environmental geophysics is crucial for 
        environmental site assessments, pollution studies, landfill monitoring, 
        and detecting subsurface features related to industrial activities. It aids 
        in understanding the spatial distribution of contaminants, assessing remediation 
        efforts, and informing decision-making for sustainable environmental management.</p>
