  <section>
    <h2>Hello! My name is Angel</h2>
    <p>I am from Peru-Lima. I have completed my bachelor's degree in Physics and have been studying machine learning. During my time at university, I participated in projects such as the design, construction, and experimentation using solar cells and DC motors (VRI-UNI). I also engaged in a project involving the simulation and modeling of stochastic processes related to natural processes. Additionally, I worked on computer vision projects at CTIC-UNI, focusing on the reidentification of people and classification of vehicles. With this brief introduction about what I have been doing, the next section will provide more details about my interests, hobbies, and inspirations.</p>
