    <h1>AI Engineering Overview</h1>

    <p>AI Engineering involves creating systems that learn and make predictions. 
        It requires a combination of programming, statistics, and domain knowledge 
        to develop innovative solutions. To see posts about this topic, check the next <a href="#">link</a>.</p>

    <h2>Programming Languages</h2>

    <p><strong>Python:</strong> Stands out for versatility and readability, 
        dominant in AI and machine learning tasks. Extensive ecosystem with 
        libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow.</p>

    <p><strong>C++ and Java:</strong> Preferred for performance-critical 
        tasks and building scalable systems, especially in high-performance 
        machine learning algorithms.</p>

    <h2>Machine Learning and Deep Learning Frameworks</h2>

    <p><strong>PyTorch:</strong> Renowned for dynamic computation graph and 
        intuitive design, preferred among researchers.</p>

    <p><strong>TensorFlow:</strong> Open-source platform excelling in both 
        machine learning and deep learning applications. Integrated with 
        Keras for high-level API.</p>

    <h2>Frameworks to Web Development Ecosystems</h2>

    <p><strong>Panel:</strong> Python-based high-level app and dashboarding 
        solution for creating interactive web applications without extensive 
        web development knowledge.</p>

    <p><strong>Flask:</strong> Lightweight web framework offering flexibility 
        and control for a wide range of web application development purposes.</p>

    <p><strong>Dash and Shiny:</strong> Provide interactive dashboard capabilities 
        in Python and R, respectively.</p>

    <p><strong>Django:</strong> Comprehensive alternative to Flask, offering a 
        feature-rich solution with an integrated ORM system.</p>

    <h2>Management of Containers</h2>

    <p><strong>Docker:</strong> Containerization technology ensures consistent 
        and reproducible environments for seamless code and dependency packaging.</p>

    <p><strong>Kubernetes:</strong> Robust container orchestration platform 
        automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized 
        applications.</p>

    <h2>Management of Machine Learning Models</h2>

    <p><strong>MLflow:</strong> Open-source platform simplifying the machine 
        learning lifecycle with tools for experiment tracking, reproducibility, 
        and model deployment.</p>

    <p><strong>Databricks:</strong> Cloud-based analytics platform streamlining 
        the processing and analysis of large datasets, integrated with Apache Spark.</p>

    <h2>Big Data</h2>

    <p><strong>Apache Hadoop:</strong> Open-source framework providing distributed 
        storage and processing capabilities for scalable handling of vast amounts 
        of data.</p>

    <p><strong>Apache Spark:</strong> Enhances big data processing with fast 
        in-memory data processing, improving the efficiency of analytics tasks.</p>

    <p><strong>Apache Cassandra:</strong> Distributed NoSQL database crucial in 
        big data applications, providing high availability and fault tolerance.</p>

    <h2>Cloud Computing Platforms</h2>

    <p><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), 
        Microsoft Azure:</strong> Leading cloud service providers offering 
        comprehensive solutions for AI engineering and machine learning.</p>
